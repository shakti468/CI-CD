# CI/CD Pipeline for Auto-Deploying Static Website using GitHub, Python, Bash, and Nginx
This project sets up a simple CI/CD pipeline that automatically deploys a static website hosted on a GitHub repository to an Nginx server using Python and Bash scripts. The deployment process checks for new commits and updates the live website accordingly.
CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub, Python, Bash, and Nginx
This project demonstrates a basic CI/CD pipeline that automatically pulls changes from a GitHub repository and deploys them to a web server served by Nginx. The setup includes:

- A Python script to check for new commits on GitHub

- A Bash script to update the website content

- A wrapper script for automation

- A cron job to run the pipeline every 5 minutes
